 <br>
 <p><b>Lorem Ipsum </b>is simply dummy <u>text</u>  of the printing and typesetting industry.</p>
 
 <p><i><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the  <mark>1500s</mark> , when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</i></p>
 
 <p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <mark>1960s</mark> with the release of Letraset sheets containing <br> Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <b><s>Aldus PageMaker</s></b> including versions of Lorem Ipsum</p>
